    testimonial:
      "Jakob Malmgren was one of my students in the IT: Front-end Developer course at Sundsgården Folkhögskola during the fall semester 2021-2022. From the very beginning it was obvious that Jakob had a deep desire to not just learn code, but to also understand it. From the very first day, Jakob asked insightful questions and went out of his way to find answers and more information on his own. He was excited to learn new material and to improve his programming skills. With each assignment he turned in, his code got better and better which showed that he not only asked questions, but learned from the answers he received. Jakob faced each lesson with a positive attitude and it was truly a pleasure to have him in the course. I wish him all the best in the future and hope our paths cross again.",
